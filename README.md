**A comprehensive guide to building smart and reusable code in Java**

## What is this book about?
Having a knowledge of design patterns enables you, as a developer, to improve your code base, promote code reuse, and make the architecture more robust. As languages evolve, new features take time to fully understand before they are adopted en masse. The mission of this book is to ease the adoption of the latest trends and provide good practices for programmers.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the OOP and FP paradigms
* Explore the traditional Java design patterns
* Get to know the new functional features of Java
* See how design patterns are changed and affected by the new features
* Discover what reactive programming is and why is it the natural augmentation of FP
